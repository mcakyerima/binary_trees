## ALX 0x1D. C - Binary Trees Project


Welcome to the Binary Trees Project repository! This project is a playground for all things binary trees, dedicated to exploring the intricacies of data structures and algorithms in the context of binary trees.

### What You'll Find:

- **Binary Tree Implementations:** Explore various binary tree types, such as binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, and more, with clear and well-documented C code.
- **Visualization:** Visualize binary trees in action, offering an insightful perspective on their operations.
- **Algorithms:** Discover a collection of common and advanced algorithms tailored to binary tree manipulation and traversal.


### Project Goals:

My goal with this repository is to provide comprehensive resources for learning and experimenting with binary trees. Whether you're a fellow coder, a student, or an enthusiast, you'll find valuable insights and practical implementations here.
